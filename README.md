# Godot iOS Build (Unsigned IPA) â€“ GitHub Action Script

This repository provides a ready-to-use GitHub Action script for building a Godot project for iOS. It enables you to create an iOS build without requiring access to a Mac.

**The script:** [build-ios-unsigned.yml](https://github.com/petrgon/godot-unsigned-ios-build/blob/main/build-ios-unsigned.yml), copy it into `/.github/workflows/` in your repository.

Special thanks to [mak448a](https://github.com/mak448a) for their work, which served as the foundation for this script. See their [repository](https://github.com/mak448a/build-ios) for reference.

> Some one-time configuration is required. Please refer to the comments within each step of the YAML file for setup instructions.

## How to Sideload an Unsigned IPA

There are several methods to sideload an unsigned IPA onto your iOS device. Most of them typically involve the following steps:
1. Have an Apple ID and iTunes installed on your PC or Mac to retrieve your deviceâ€™s UDID.
1. Install a sideloading server on your PC or Mac and connect it with your Apple account.
1. Download a third-party app store and mark it as trusted.
1. Install the IPA file using the third-party app store.
1. Enable Developer Mode on your iOS device.
1. Add your Apple account as a trusted developer on your iOS device.

> [!WARNING]
> The sideloaded app will remain available on your device for 7 days. After that period, you will need to renew its authorization using the sideloading server.
